## Welcome to our course on how to run meta-analysis in R!

Note: Content is in black, <span style="color:green">exercises in green.</span>

In this initial set-up we load the necessary packages. If you don't already have these packages installed, run the "install.packages" command which has been commented out.

Note that colored text following a hash symbol (#) in the code chunk is not read by R but simply provides a description of the code to make it easier to follow.

```{r setup, echo = TRUE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T,
                      results = "markup")

# install.packages(c("metafor", "ggpubr", "readxl", "janitor"))

library(metafor) # for meta-analysis
library(meta) # for meta-analysis
library(ggpubr) # general plotting
library(readxl) # loading data from Excel
library(janitor) # cleaning data
library(tidyverse) # general tidy data

# setting working directory to current folder

# 1 Data types and effect measures

In meta-analysis, we aim to aggregate across many studies. Typical output is a forest plot showing the individual study effects plus their statistical certainty (confidence interval, CI).

![](forest_plot_example.jpg)

For quantitatively aggregating across many studies, we need:

* The same measure of effect for every study
* Uncertainty in the effect measure (standard error; 95%-CI; variance)

There are different data types (scales) that we might be interest in:

* Continuous measures (time, size, …)
* Binary / categorical outcomes (death, drop-out, therapy response, …)
* Time-to-event (survival, onset of disease, …)

Hence, we have different effect measures:

* Continuous: raw mean difference, standardised mean difference (SMD), normalised mean difference
* Binary: odds ratio, risk ratio
* Time-to-event: hazard ratio



# 2 Introduction to the working example & data set

__Centrofobic rats (in pain)__

This dataset is taken from a published systematic review titled "A systematic review and meta-analysis of thigmotactic behaviour in the open field test in rodent models associated with persistent pain", published in PLOS One in 2023, by Zhang and colleagues. For the full paper [please see PLOS One here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0290382). 

This systematic review is investigating how rodents with persistent pain behave in the open field test. Therefore the main outcome in this data set is behaviour in the open field test. 


```{r}
DatTH <- as.data.frame(read_xlsx("Data Zhang Fig 2 (complete).xlsx")) # load data.

DatTH <- clean_names(DatTH) # clean variable names to get R-friendly ones
```


# 3 Extracting data

For calculating effect measures, we need to extract:

* sample sizes n
* group differences (e.g. means)
* variances (e.g. standard deviations, SDs)

In papers, we can get those from:

* text
* tables
* figures (common for animal study MAs! Use e.g. WebPlotDigitizer for extraction)

# 4 Calculate Effect size: SMD

First, we will calculate an effect size for each experiment in the data set. An effect size is a measure of the difference between two experimental cohorts.

Behaviour is a continuous variable and we will calculate a Standardised Mean Difference, using the control (vehicle-treated) and the model induction (pain model) groups. 

First, we will calculate SMD effect sizes manually.

SMD formula: 

$$
SMD_i = \frac{\bar{x}_c - \bar{x}_{rx}}{S_{pooled}} \times \left(1 - \frac{3}{4N - 9} \right)
$$
$$
S_{pooled} = \sqrt{ \frac{(n'_c - 1)SD_c^2 + (n_{rx} - 1)SD_{rx}^2}{N - 2} }
$$

$$
VAR = \frac{N}{n_{rx} \times n'_c} + \frac{SMD_i^2}{2(N - 3.49)}
$$
__Control group sample size__

Watch out for the controls:

A single experiment can contain a number of comparisons. If the control cohort is serving more than one treatment group, we correct the number of animals reported in the control cohort by the number of treatment groups.

$$
n'_c = \frac{n_c}{num.treatment groups}
$$

### <span style="color:green">Pooled SD</span>

<span style="color:green">First we calculate the pooled standard deviation.</span>  

<span style="color:green">Then we examine the data set, to view the columns that contain the mean, standard deviation, and number of animals in the control and model groups:</span>

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

DatTH$pooledSD <- sqrt(((DatTH$ne - 1) * DatTH$se^2 + (DatTH$nc - 1) * DatTH$sc^2) / (DatTH$ne + DatTH$nc - 2))

head(DatTH[c("mc", "me", "se", "sc", "ne", "nc", "pooledSD")])

```

<span style="color:green">These 7 variables are the variables we will use to calculate the effect size. You view the variables to check that they contain the correct data.</span>
 

### <span style="color:green">Hedges g</span>

<span style="color:green">Now let’s calculate an SMD effect size for each experiment (saved as the variable “smd”) and add the effect size data as a new column in the DatTH data set. Remember, each variable in this equation is a list of numbers, with each entry corresponding to a single experiment.</span>  

<span style="color:green">Again, we check that the new variable have been added correctly.</span>


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

DatTH$smd <- ((DatTH$me - DatTH$mc) / DatTH$pooledSD) * (1 - 3 /(4*DatTH$n_total - 9))

head(DatTH[c("mc", "me", "se", "sc", "ne", "nc", "pooledSD", "smd")])

```


### <span style="color:green">Sampling Variance</span>

<span style="color:green">We will now calculate the squared standard error for each experiment (and save this as a new variable “variance”).</span>  

<span style="color:green">Again, we check that the new variable have been added correctly.</span>


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

# Sampling Variance

DatTH$variance <- 1 / DatTH$ne + 1 / DatTH$nc + DatTH$smd^2 / (2 * (DatTH$n_total))

head(DatTH[c("mc", "me", "se", "sc", "ne", "nc", "pooledSD", "smd", "variance")])

```



### <span style="color:green">Plotting SMDs for spotting outliers</span>


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

<span style="color:green; font-weight:bold"> -> Description: metafor gives us the same SMDs like above (yi = smd), but with less code. E.g., compare -3.58 from the first study.</span>




# 5 Meta-analytical models

### __Meta-analysis = Weighted average of effects__

Logic: Weight study results by study specific uncertainty (size, SD, effect)
Studies get a larger weight, when:

* Larger N
* Smaller SD
* Larger group difference


### __Fixed effects model__

![](fixed_effects_model.jpg)
Mathematically, this corresponds to a "simple" weighting of the individual study effects:

$$
\hat{\theta} = \frac{\sum w_i \theta_i}{\sum w_i}, \quad \text{where } w_i = \frac{1}{\text{VAR}}
$$

### __Random effects model__

![](random_effects_model.jpg)
Thus, we have to add in another parameter: $\tau$


$$
\hat{\mu} = \frac{\sum w_i y_i}{\sum w_i}
$$

$$
w_i = \frac{1}{v_i + \hat{\tau}^2}
$$

$$
Var[\hat{\mu}] = \frac{1}{\sum w_i}
$$

* REM is the standard nowadays and the default in metafor
* Estimator: Restricted maximum likelihood (REML), default in metafor
* Confidence intervals: Via method by Knapp-Hartung, set in metafor via test = "knha"

```

<span style="color:green; font-weight:bold"> -> Description: The aggregated (average) SMD is -1.14, with a p < .001. I.e., mice in experimental groups showed way stronger thigmotactic behavior than controls do (LESS time in center). The outcome measure "thigmotaxis" seems to be sensitive for measuring pain. </span>




# 6 Forest Plot

A forest plot is a way to visualise the effect size and confidence interval for each individual study in a meta-analysis. 

![](forest_plot_example2.jpg)
Description: This is a publication-ready forest plot (for the sake of space, some studies are left out in the middle). The aggregated (i.e., average) effect is the diamond on the bottom, including its confidence interval (log OR=-1.07 [-1.30, -0.85], i.e., significant). The plot differentiates two types of studies by color (RCTs in green). All three measures of heterogeneity are given; there seems to be little heterogeneity for the overall effect (I² = 34%). The plot mentions the raw numbers for each study (columns labelled "No. of events / total").

There are lots of options to modify forest plots in metafor. Here are some graphical parameters to play with:

# 7 Heterogeneity

“Statistical heterogeneity manifests itself in the… [study] effects being more different from each other than one would expect due to random error (chance) alone” -- Cochrane Handbook

Heterogeneity = Unexpected amount of variation in effect sizes between studies (above the amount we would expect due to sampling error)

Measured via:

* Q-test statistic: p-value of a significance test (indicates statistically significant heterogeneity)
* $\tau^2$: raw variance from the random-effects model (all sources of variation! Hard to interpret due to abstract unit of measurement)
* $I^2$: how much of the total variability in the effect size estimates is due to heterogeneity among the true effects?

$$
I^2 = 100\% \times \frac{\hat{\tau}^2_{RE}}{\hat{\tau}^2_{RE} + s^2}
$$

Cochrane's rule of thumb on $I^2$:

* 0% to 40%: might not be important
* 30% to 60%:moderate heterogeneity
* 50% to 90%: substantial heterogeneity
* 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity


__Heterogeneity – a bad thing?__

* In clinical MAs, heterogeneity is traditionally a nuisance
* By understanding the sources of heterogeneity, we can better understand mechanisms at work
* Especially important in the light of translational failure in preclinical research
* Heterogeneity might thus be a desirable property of our MA
* Heterogeneity in experimental setups increases replicability (Usui et al, 2021)

# 8 Exploring Heterogenity - Meta-Regression

__Heterogeneity in preclinical studies__

* Heterogeneity is typically greater in preclinical than in clinical MAs

* Study‐level variables that may influence the direction/size of the outcome
  * substantive variables (characteristics of the treatment, context, subjects)
  * methodological variables (e.g., randomized versus non‐randomized study)
  * extrinsic variables (e.g., publication year, published/unpublished)


* In preclinical data:
  * Study samples (e.g. species, sex) 
  * Interventions or outcomes (dose, outcome types) 
  * Methodology: outcome measures used, quality etc. 


## Meta-Regression

* -> Using regression analysis to evaluate the relevance of these study-specific features for the found effect
* The variables are also called “moderators” of the effect


A linear regression is described by:

* An equation for the line: $\hat{y} = a + b \times x$
* R² as measure of quality: How much variance in y can be predicted by x?
* I² is also a variance proportion!
* -> How much variance (I²) can be explained by the moderator?

# 9 Detecting Small Study Effects (Publication bias)

__Publication bias__


* Publication bias occurs when the results of published and unpublished studies differ systematically
* Neutral and negative studies:
  * Take longer to publish
  * Remain unpublished 
  * Less likely to be identified in systematic review
  * Leads to the overstatement of efficacy in meta-analysis
* Selective outcome reporting
* Selective analysis reporting


Put differently, assumptions on "small study effects" are: 
* Larger studies with more commitment of resources and time -> more likely to be published
* Smaller studies have greater risk of generating non-significant findings
* Smaller studies therefore are more likely to “remain in the file drawer”


__Funnel plot__

Funnel plot: Effect size plotted against the standard error (SE).

When using the SMD, they are susceptible to distortion, leading to overestimation of the existence and extent of publication bias [(Zwetsloot et al., 2017)(https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24260). We therefore recommend plotting funnel plots where SMD is the effect size, against a sample size-based precision estimate. 



## <span style="color:green">9a Exercise</span>

<span style="color:green; font-style:italic">Create a funnel plot for our meta-analysis</span>
<span style="color:green; font-style:italic">Overwrite the default and use an inverse of N: yaxis = "sqrtninv" 
</span>


```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'asis'}

funnel_plot <- funnel(
      # specify the meta-analysis to plot
       meta1,
       xlab = "Standardised Mean Difference (SMD)",
       # for getting nice y axis label
       ylab = expression(sqrt(1/n)), 
       # specify the measure plotted on the y axis, "sqrtninv", ie the square root of the inverse of N
       yaxis = "sqrtninv", 
       # specify the title
       main = "Funnel Plot")


```


## Funnel plot asymmetry

In addition to assessing the funnel plot visually, we can test for asymmetry statistically. Here we will use Egger’s test, which is a weighted linear regression of the treatment effect on its standard error.

<span style="color:green; font-style:italic">Calculate an Egger‘s regression</span>
* <span style="color:green; font-style:italic">regtest()</span>
* <span style="color:green; font-style:italic">Add the line to the funnel (code is prepared)</span>


```{r}
reg <- regtest(
  # specify the random-effects model
  meta1, 
  # define the data set
  data = DatSMD, 
        
        model="rma", 
        
        # specify the predictor to use for the regression test
        predictor="sqrtninv", 
        ret.fit=FALSE)

reg


# funnel plot with regression line
funnel_plot <- funnel(
      # specify the meta-analysis to plot
       meta1,
       xlab = "Standardised Mean Difference (SMD)",
       # for getting nice y axis label
       ylab = expression(sqrt(1/n)), 
       # specify the measure plotted on the y axis, "sqrtninv", ie the square root of the inverse of N
       yaxis = "sqrtninv", 
       # specify the title
       main = "Funnel Plot")

# generate some values for the y axis (just so R knows where to plot stuff)
yvalues <- seq(0, 2.5, length=100) 
# add Eggger's regression line
lines(coef(reg$fit)[1] + coef(reg$fit)[2]*yvalues, # reads the regression result
      yvalues, 
      lwd=2)

```

<span style="color:green; font-weight:bold"> -> Description: No statistically significant asymmetry can be found (p = 0.8890). Egger's regression line is almost vertical. </span>



## Trim and Fill 
We can also estimate and adjust for the number and outcomes of theoretically missing studies in a meta-analysis, using a method called trim and fill. We can test for and impute missing studies using the function "trimfill()":

```{r}
thigTrim1 <- trimfill(meta1)           

# view the results of the trim-and-fill analysis
thigTrim1 
```

__-> Description: No asymmetry, as no studies (0) need to be filled in.__

As there is not much happening in our case - let's tweak the data a bit for the purposes of this teaching workshop only

```{r}

meta2 <- rma(yi,
             vi,
             # filter out studies with an effect above -2
             data = DatSMD[DatSMD$yi < -2,], 
             test = "knha"
)
summary(meta2)

thigTrim2 <- trimfill(meta2)

# view the results of the trim-and-fill analysis
thigTrim2 
```

__-> Description: We succeeded in biasing the MA's result by systematically deleting studies (average SMD = -2.69!). Trim & fill tells us, there now is asymmetry and 4 studies on the right are missing to balance it out.__

You can draw a funnel plot of the filled data using the function "funnel()":

```{r}
thigTrimFun <- funnel(thigTrim2,
  # specify the x axis label
  xlab = "SMD", 
  # specify the measure plotted on the y axis, "sqrtninv", ie the square root of the inverse of N
  yaxis = "sqrtninv"  
)

```

__-> Description: The gap of studies that we deliberately introduced is filled in and thus indicates asymmetry.__
